In this website, I will be talking about my work in the computer science course, and going over what I have learned and accomplished, along with what I hope to do with this knowloedge in the future. For starters, I will go over projects that I have completed and wish to be evaluated. We were assigned 16 projects and asked to do 10 of them. I will go over the 10 in detail below.</p>

         <p>In this project, I learned how to use a workflow, meaning I learned how to naviguate to get the files that I was working on in Github onto my personal computer, and vice versa. I accopmlished this by using Git Bash as a terminal, and learning commands such as git clone, git commit-m, git pull, and git push</p>

Here, I got to follow Dan Shiffman's coding tutorial where he showed us how to code the browser game Flappy bird from scratch, and I was super proud that I was able to ge it to work and add my own variations. I used p5 for this project.</p>

         <p>For this assignment, I had to make my own Github Profile. This meant that ALL of the coding work that I accomplished was added onto my Github page, and showcased for anyone in the world to see, including future employers. I learned about commits, repositories, files, cloning, uploading, and forking.</p>

Using HTML and CSS, I built my own Football website from scratch, and I learned so much about building with html. I was extremely proud of the website that I made.</p>

My group and I updated our repo weekly, and we were proud that we accomplished it by getting the switch to work.</p>

         <h3>10. Cellular Automata - The Game Of Life</h3> 
         <p>For this assignment, I followed along with Dan Shiffman in his explanation videos as well as Game of Life Tutorial. I made an index.html file and a js file, and I also made a readme that went over everything that I learned. I loved the tutorials, they were so informative, and I was glad that I was able to make it through all of them!</p>

        <div class="my-auto">
          <h2 class="mb-5">The Future</h2>
          <p> I have learned so many interesting and important things relating to coding and web development in this course, and there is so much that I can continue to learn and accomplish. I am hoping to go further down this path of knowledge and continue to broaden my horizons by learning more.
          </p><p>For starters, Khan Academy. I for one really enjoyed learning on Khan Academy. The tutorials were very informative, and the teachers are very accessible should I have questions. One of the places where I would like to continue learning on is on Khan Academy. More specifically, I would like
          to learn more about Javascript. I am thinking to do the Advanced JS courses on Khan Academy next, and seeking more information related to Animation, which is my favourite subject of them all. I think it is a great place to start!
          </p><p>Additionally, I would like to improve my workflow, and more specifically, my ability to naviguate it. When using my workflow, I feel as if I have landed on a huge island, and I have only explored one tiny portion of it. There is so much out there for me to discover about the things that I can do with
          a workflow and Git Bash, and I am sure if I continue to study this, I will learn some extremely helpful things about workflows.</p>
          <p> Lastly, I want to learn more languages. For coding, and being a successful coder in the industry, it is very important to know multiple languages for coding. So far, I know Actionscript, Turing, Javascript, HTML, and React. I would like to learn more however, to be able to become more useful in the industry. 
          The next language that I want to learn is Python, since I heard that lots of universities and businesses/companies use that language, and after this course, I feel as if I have a good base line and would be able to pick up Python fairly quickly.</p>
