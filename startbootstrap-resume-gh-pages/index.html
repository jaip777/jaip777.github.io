       <small>My Github Portfolio</small>




     </h1>




 <!-- Introduction paragraph -->




     <p>Hi! My name is Jai Prasad and I am a grade 12 student attending A. Y. Jackson Secondary School. In this website, I will be talking about my work in the computer science course, and going over what I have learned and accomplished, along with what I hope to do with this knowloedge in the future. For starters, I will go over projects that I have completed. We were assigned 16 projects and asked to do 10 of them. I ended up completing 11 of them, which I will go over right now!</p>

         <h3>1. Intro to JS</h3>




         <!--  Description and view repo -->




         <p>The first project that I completed in this course was the Intro to Javascript section on Khan Academy. Here, I completed all of the challenges, tutorials, and 9 projects. In doing this, I learned about basics of Javascript and I was able to use this throughout the course.</p>

         <h3>2. Intro to HTML and CSS</h3> 




         <p>In this project, I completed the Intro to HTML and CSS section of Khan Academy. I learned all about the basics of these languages, and I was super proud taht I was able to use them to later build my own website! I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project!</p>

         <h3>3. Workflow</h3> 




         <p>In this project, I learned how to use a workflow, meaning I learned how to naviguate to get the files that I was working on in Github onto my personal computer, and vice versa. I accopmlished this by using Git Bash as a terminal, and learning commands such as git clone, git commit-m, git pull, and git push</p>

         <h3>4. Dan Shiffman's Coding Callenge: Flappy Bird</h3> 




         <p>This project was by far my favourite of all of them this year. Here, I got to follow Dan Shiffman's coding tutorial where he showed us how to code the browser game Flappy bird from scratch, and I was super proud that I was able to ge it to work and add my own variations. I used p5 for this project.</p>

         <h3>5. Github Profile</h3> 




         <p>For this assignment, I had to make my own Github Profile. This meant that ALL of the coding work that I accomplished was added onto my Github page, and showcased for anyone in the world to see, including future employers. I learned about commits, repositories, files, cloning, uploading, and forking.</p>

         <p>In this project, I completed the Nature of Code section on Khan Academy. This was the most challenging thing that I did in this course, and I was proud that I was able to complete all challenges and projects. I learned lots about complex math and how it is used in coding.</p>

         <h3>7. 20 Time Project</h3> 




         <p>This was the project that I learned the most about coding in completing, since it was a project that I got to do without any guidelines. Using HTML and CSS, I built my own Football website from scratch, and I learned so much about building with html. I was extremely proud of the website that I made.</p>
